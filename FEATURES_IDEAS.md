## Centralized Properties Panel for Tracks and Speakers

### Overview
A unified properties panel to centralize all relevant properties and operators for tracks and speakers, specifically for Holophonix processor interactions. This panel will streamline workflows by providing a single interface for managing these elements.

### Features
1. **Tracks Section**:
   - **Individual Tracks**:
     - Display and edit properties (e.g., name, GLB file, color, location, physics behaviors).
     - Manage NodeOSC/object relationships, including activating specific incoming/outgoing OSC handlers.
   - **Groups of Tracks**:
     - Display and edit group-level properties (e.g., relationships between objects in a group, trajectory curve interactions).
     - Manage NodeOSC/group relationships, including activating specific incoming/outgoing OSC handlers for the group.
2. **Speakers Section**:
   - **Individual Speakers**:
     - Display and edit properties (e.g., name, GLB file, color, location, physics behaviors).
     - Manage NodeOSC/object relationships, including activating specific incoming/outgoing OSC handlers.
   - **Groups of Speakers**:
     - Display and edit group-level properties (e.g., relationships between objects in a group, trajectory curve interactions).
     - Manage NodeOSC/group relationships, including activating specific incoming/outgoing OSC handlers for the group.
3. **Holophonix Processor Integration**:
   - Direct interaction with the Holophonix processor for real-time updates.
   - Visual feedback for processor-related properties (e.g., latency, signal routing).

### Challenges
1. **Intuitive Design**:
   - Ensure the panel is user-friendly and easy to navigate.
2. **Scalability**:
   - Handle large numbers of tracks and speakers efficiently.
3. **Group Management**:
   - Develop robust logic for managing groups of tracks and speakers, including group-level operations.
4. **Integration**:
   - Seamlessly integrate with existing Blender workflows and Holophonix processor interactions.

### Implementation Steps
1. **UI Design**:
   - Sketch a layout for the properties panel, including sections for tracks, speakers, and groups.
2. **Backend Logic**:
   - Develop functions to fetch and update properties for individual and grouped tracks/speakers.
3. **Processor Integration**:
   - Implement real-time communication with the Holophonix processor for property updates.
4. **Testing**:
   - Test the panel with various scenarios, including large numbers of tracks/speakers and group operations.


## Default `.hol` File Selection Based on `manifest.json`

### Overview
Automatically select the default `.hol` file based on the `defaultPreset` value specified in the `manifest.json` file. This feature ensures that the correct preset is selected by default, enhancing the user experience and reducing manual selection errors.

### Features
1. **Manifest File Parsing**:
   - Read the `manifest.json` file to retrieve the `defaultPreset` value.
2. **Default `.hol` File Selection**:
   - Search for the corresponding `.hol` file in the `Presets` directory.
   - Set the default value of the `.hol` file dropdown to the index of the default `.hol` file.

### Challenges
1. **File Validation**:
   - Ensure the `manifest.json` file is correctly formatted and contains the `defaultPreset` value.
2. **File Availability**:
   - Handle cases where the default `.hol` file is not found in the `Presets` directory.
3. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Ensure the default selection updates dynamically when the `manifest.json` file or `.hol` file list changes.

### Implementation Steps
1. **File Parsing Logic**:
   - Develop a function to read and parse the `manifest.json` file.
2. **Default File Index Calculation**:
   - Implement logic to find the index of the default `.hol` file in the list of available `.hol` files.
3. **UI Integration**:
   - Update the `.hol` file dropdown to use the calculated default index.
4. **Testing**:
   - Test the feature with various scenarios, including missing `manifest.json` files and unavailable `.hol` files.
