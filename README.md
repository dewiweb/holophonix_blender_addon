# Holophonix Utils

A Blender addon providing various utility functions for Holophonix projects, including management of Tracks, speakers, handlers, and OSC operations.

## Features

### Track Management

- **Track Import**:
  - Imports Tracks from a Holophonix `.hol` preset file
  - Replaces existing Tracks with those from the imported file
  - Handles Track numbering and naming conventions

- **Track Properties**:
  - Manages Track coordinates (cartesian and spherical)
  - Handles Track colors and materials
  - Supports custom 3D models for Tracks

- **Track Creation**:
  - Creates Tracks from imported data
  - Assigns appropriate 3D models from the `amadeus.blend` file
  - Sets Track locations based on imported coordinates

- **Track Deletion**:
  - Clears existing Tracks before importing new ones
  - Removes unused meshes and materials

- **Coordinate Conversion**:
  - Converts between cartesian and spherical coordinate systems
  - Handles elevation, azimuth, and distance calculations

### Speaker Management

- **Speaker Import**:
  - Imports Speakers from a Holophonix `.hol` preset file
  - Replaces existing Speakers with those from the imported file
  - Handles Speaker numbering and naming conventions

- **Speaker Properties**:
  - Manages Speaker coordinates (cartesian and spherical)
  - Handles Speaker colors and materials
  - Supports custom 3D models for Speakers

- **Speaker Creation**:
  - Creates Speakers from imported data
  - Assigns appropriate 3D models from the `amadeus.blend` file
  - Sets Speaker locations based on imported coordinates

- **Speaker Deletion**:
  - Clears existing Speakers before importing new ones
  - Removes unused meshes and materials

- **Speaker Orientation**:
  - Manages Speaker rotation and orientation
  - Supports auto-orientation and manual rotation settings
  - Handles pan, tilt, and roll parameters

- **Coordinate Conversion**:
  - Converts between cartesian and spherical coordinate systems
  - Handles elevation, azimuth, and distance calculations

### Handler Management

- **Add Handlers**: Add special handlers to manage specific tasks or events. For example, you can create a handler to trigger an animation when a specific event occurs.
- **Remove Handlers**: Remove handlers when they are no longer needed. This helps keep your project organized and prevents unnecessary handlers from interfering with your workflow.
- **Configure Handler Properties**: Set properties such as priority, event type, and callback functions. This allows you to fine-tune your handlers to suit your specific needs.

### OSC Operations

- **Manage OSC Nodes**: Create, configure, and delete OSC nodes for communication. OSC nodes enable you to send and receive OSC messages, allowing you to control external devices or trigger events in Blender.
- **Configure OSC Settings**: Set parameters like IP address, port, and message format. This ensures that your OSC nodes are properly configured for communication.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Sending OSC messages to control external devices, such as lighting or sound systems.
  - Receiving OSC messages to trigger events in Blender, such as starting an animation or changing a scene.
  - Controlling track animations, such as synchronizing audio and visual elements.

### AN Settings

- **Configure AN-Specific Settings**: Adjust settings related to Animation Nodes functionality. This includes settings for node execution, debugging, and performance optimization.
- **Manage AN Tree Imports**: Import and export AN trees for reuse across projects. This allows you to share complex animations and node setups with other users or projects.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Automating complex animations with imported AN trees, such as character rigging or physics simulations.
  - Sharing AN trees with other users or projects, enabling collaboration and reuse of complex node setups.

## About Holophonix

The Holophonix Processor is an advanced real-time immersive audio environment optimized for the performing arts field. It enables precise spatial audio control, allowing users to create immersive soundscapes for live performances, installations, and other artistic applications. The processor integrates advanced 2D and 3D sound algorithms developed at IRCAM, supporting object-based mixing and multiple spatialization techniques.

### Key Features
- **2D and 3D Spatialization**: Utilize cutting-edge algorithms for precise sound placement in both 2D and 3D spaces.
- **Object-Based Mixing**: Associate input channels with various object types for flexible and dynamic audio control.
- **Active Acoustic Enhancement**: Enhance the acoustic properties of a space in real-time.

### Purpose of the Blender Addon

The Holophonix Utils addon integrates the Holophonix Processorâ€™s capabilities into Blender, enabling users to:
- **Visualize Audio in 3D**: Represent sound sources (e.g., tracks, speakers) as 3D objects in Blender, allowing for intuitive spatial audio design.
- **Synchronize Audio and Visuals**: Use OSC messages to control animations, lighting, and other visual elements in Blender, ensuring perfect synchronization with the audio.
- **Streamline Workflows**: Simplify the process of importing and managing Holophonix presets, tracks, and speakers within Blender.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release
2. In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
3. Click 'Install...' and select the downloaded zip file
4. Enable the addon

## Dependencies

- Blender 4.3 or higher
- [Animation Nodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes): A node-based visual scripting system for Blender, enabling complex animations and procedural workflows. Required for AN tree functionality in the Holophonix Utils addon.
- [NodeOSC](https://github.com/maybites/NodeOSC): A Blender addon for Open Sound Control (OSC) communication, enabling real-time interaction between Blender and external devices. Required for OSC operations in the Holophonix Utils addon.

## Assets

The `amadeus.blend` file in the assets directory contains:
- 3D models of Amadeus speakers
- Track models supported by default in the Holophonix Processor
- Animation Nodes' AN Tree necessary for Animation Nodes functionalities

This file enables importing Tracks and speakers from a Holophonix project's `.hol` file.
