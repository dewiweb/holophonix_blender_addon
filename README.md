- **Optional Tracks and Speakers Import**: Import tracks and speakers from `.hol` files using a dropdown menu.

### Speaker Management

- **Speaker Import**:
  - Imports Speakers from a Holophonix `.hol` preset file
  - Replaces existing Speakers with those from the imported file
  - Handles Speaker numbering and naming conventions

  - Creates Speakers from imported data
  - Assigns appropriate 3D models from the `amadeus.blend` file
  - Sets Speaker locations based on imported coordinates

- **Speaker Deletion**:
  - Clears existing Speakers before importing new ones
  - Removes unused meshes and materials

- **Speaker Orientation**:
  - Manages Speaker rotation and orientation
  - Supports auto-orientation and manual rotation settings
  - Handles pan, tilt, and roll parameters

- **Coordinate Conversion**:
  - Converts between cartesian and spherical coordinate systems
  - Handles elevation, azimuth, and distance calculations

### Handler Management

- **Add Handlers**: Add special handlers to manage specific tasks or events. For example, you can create a handler to trigger an animation when a specific event occurs.
- **Remove Handlers**: Remove handlers when they are no longer needed. This helps keep your project organized and prevents unnecessary handlers from interfering with your workflow.
- **Configure Handler Properties**: Set properties such as priority, event type, and callback functions. This allows you to fine-tune your handlers to suit your specific needs.

### OSC Operations

- **Manage OSC Nodes**: Create, configure, and delete OSC nodes for communication. OSC nodes enable you to send and receive OSC messages, allowing you to control external devices or trigger events in Blender.
- **Configure OSC Settings**: Parse and import OSC settings from `manifest.json` for real-time communication.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Sending OSC messages to control external devices, such as lighting or sound systems.
  - Receiving OSC messages to trigger events in Blender, such as starting an animation or changing a scene.
  - Controlling track animations, such as synchronizing audio and visual elements.

### AN Settings

- **Configure AN-Specific Settings**: Adjust settings related to Animation Nodes functionality. This includes settings for node execution, debugging, and performance optimization.
- **Manage AN Tree Imports**: Import and export AN trees for reuse across projects. This allows you to share complex animations and node setups with other users or projects.
- **Example Use Cases**:
  - Automating complex animations with imported AN trees, such as character rigging or physics simulations.
  - Sharing AN trees with other users or projects, enabling collaboration and reuse of complex node setups.

### Project Import System

The addon supports importing Holophonix projects from `.zip` archives:

1. **Archive Structure**:
   - Contains multiple `.hol` preset files
   - Maintains project relationships and structure

2. **File Selection**:
   - Provides dropdown menu to choose specific `.hol` files
   - Presents available presets in user-friendly format

3. **Processing**:
   - Extracts and processes selected preset files
   - Maintains consistent project structure
   - Handles errors and invalid files gracefully

### Venue Loading System

The addon includes a robust venue loading system that:
- Maintains consistent scale and orientation across imports
- Includes error handling for invalid archives
- Supports custom panel icons and default state
- **Optional Venue Loading**: Load `.glb` files with scale, position, and rotation metadata from `manifest.json`.

## User Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Enable the Addon**:
   - Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
   - Search for 'Holophonix Utils' and enable it

2. **Access the Panel**:
   - Open the 3D View sidebar (N key)
   - Find the 'Holophonix Utils' tab

3. **Import Your Setup**:
   - Click 'Import' in the Sources or Speakers panel
   - Select your `.hol` preset file

4. **Configure OSC**:
   - Set up your OSC connections in the NodeOSC panel
   - Enable handlers for the features you need

### Practical Examples

**Live Performance Setup**:
1. Import your venue's speaker layout
2. Configure OSC to control audio parameters
3. Create visualizations that respond to audio

**Interactive Installation**:
1. Set up multiple Holophonix presets
2. Create handlers for interactive elements
3. Sync multiple installations via OSC

### Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Tracks/Speakers not appearing
- Verify your `.hol` file format
- Check Blender's console for import errors

**Issue**: OSC not working
- Confirm IP and port settings
- Check firewall/network settings
- Verify NodeOSC is properly configured

## About Holophonix

The Holophonix Processor is an advanced real-time immersive audio environment optimized for the performing arts field. It enables precise spatial audio control, allowing users to create immersive soundscapes for live performances, installations, and other artistic applications. The processor integrates advanced 2D and 3D sound algorithms developed at IRCAM, supporting object-based mixing and multiple spatialization techniques.

### Key Features
- **2D and 3D Spatialization**: Utilize cutting-edge algorithms for precise sound placement in both 2D and 3D spaces.
- **Object-Based Mixing**: Associate input channels with various object types for flexible and dynamic audio control.
- **Active Acoustic Enhancement**: Enhance the acoustic properties of a space in real-time.

For more details, visit the [Holophonix Documentation](https://holophonix.xyz/documentation/docs/intro).

### Purpose of the Blender Addon

The Holophonix Utils addon integrates the Holophonix Processorâ€™s capabilities into Blender, enabling users to:
- **Visualize Audio in 3D**: Represent sound sources (e.g., tracks, speakers) as 3D objects in Blender, allowing for intuitive spatial audio design.
- **Synchronize Audio and Visuals**: Use OSC messages to control animations, lighting, and other visual elements in Blender, ensuring perfect synchronization with the audio.
- **Streamline Workflows**: Simplify the process of importing and managing Holophonix presets, tracks, and speakers within Blender.
